about=Lateral spreading is a geotechnical phenomenon that occurs when the ground moves laterally under the influence of external forces, such as an earthquake. This phenomenon is also influenced by the morphological slope of the terrain. It primarily occurs in water-saturated sandy soils that, when subjected to stress, lose their cohesion and behave like a fluid; a phenomenon known as liquefaction. As a result, the ground moves laterally, creating potential risks for buildings and infrastructure.
